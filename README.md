# Design Journey (WIP)

Start of a Wordpress plugin to enable a multi-step form to survey customer on sites such as a Digital Marketing agency.

Using Timber for templating, JavaScript for dynamic features, and plain CSS to be replaced by a preprocessor (before development continues).

Is "plug and play" with any themes as it just requires hooks on a page and the plugin takes care of the rest.
